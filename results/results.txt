All test runs were run for 1,000 iterations on a machine with 2 cores and and 2 a maximum of 2 threads per core.

datapt:
The results of the timing tests for datapt can be seen in dataGraph.png.
In the graph, it was shown that on the testing machine, 1 thread was fastest until 1,000 points.
2 threads is fastest between 1,000 points and 100,000.
Once 1,000,000 points is reached, 4 threads is fastest and 2 threads is second fastest. tests done with larger numbers of points continue the trend.

taskpt:
The results of the timing tests for datapt can be seen in taskGraph.png.
The timing tests show that taskpt is over 200 times slower than the non task paralell version no matter the number of points.

From these results, it is clear that for this task, data parallelism requires a large amount of points to be effective, and task paralelism is not effective at all.
